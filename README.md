**Overview: **
This repository contains our submission for the 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl competition hosted on Kaggle. The challenge focuses on analyzing pre-snap player tracking data to uncover patterns and make actionable predictions about team and player behavior post-snap. This year's theme encourages creativity and insight into player movements, formations, and tendencies before the snap to predict outcomes such as play type, scheme, or individual assignments.

Objective
Leverage the provided Next Gen Stats tracking data to:

Generate innovative metrics for player or team performance.
Predict offensive and defensive tendencies post-snap.
Create actionable insights for coaching, scouting, and strategic analysis.

Tracks and Submission
Our approach aligns with the Metric Track, where we use pre-snap data to evaluate team and player strategy and its relationship to post-snap outcomes. We aim to provide detailed analysis focusing on offensive and defensive schemes, player roles, and game-changing insights.
